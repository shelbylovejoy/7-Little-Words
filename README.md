# 7-Little-Words
Recreation of Seven Little Words game

This code was done as a class project in my Advanced Topics class. 
I created the 7 Little Words game with the ability to guess words ranging from 6 to 12 letters. 
The game runs is coded in Python and was done in VS Code. 
The .txt file is my words and their clues.
